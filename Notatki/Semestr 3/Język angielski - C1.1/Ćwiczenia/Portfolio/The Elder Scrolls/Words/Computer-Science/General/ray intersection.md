Definition:

A ray intersection is the point where a ray of light, sound, or other energy source intersects an object.

The intersection point is the location where the ray of energy touches the surface of the object.

Ray intersection is a fundamental concept in many fields, including computer graphics, physics, and engineering.

It is used to calculate the shadows, reflections, and refractions of light, to simulate the behavior of sound waves, and to model the flow of fluids.

There are many different algorithms for calculating ray intersections, and the best algorithm for a particular task will depend on the specific application.

One common [algorithm](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Computer-Science/General/algorithm.md) for calculating ray intersections is the ray-tracing [algorithm](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Computer-Science/General/algorithm.md).

This [algorithm](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Computer-Science/General/algorithm.md) traces the path of a ray of light through a scene, and it calculates the intersection point with each object in the scene.

Ray tracing is a computationally intensive algorithm, but it can produce very realistic images.
