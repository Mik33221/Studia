Definition:
A mesh is a network of interconnected lines or curves that can be used to represent a three-dimensional object.

Meshes are commonly used in computer graphics to represent objects such as characters, buildings, and landscapes.

They are also used in other fields, such as engineering and medicine, to represent objects with complex shapes.

There are many different types of meshes, but they all share the same basic principle: a mesh is made up of a collection of [vertices](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Math/Objects/vertex.md), edges, and faces.

[Vertices](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Math/Objects/vertex.md) are the points where the lines or curves in the mesh meet.

Edges are the lines or curves that connect the vertices.

Faces are the areas enclosed by the edges.

The number of [vertices](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Math/Objects/vertex.md), edges, and faces in a mesh can vary depending on the complexity of the object being represented.

For example, a simple object such as a cube would have only eight [vertices](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Math/Objects/vertex.md), twelve edges, and six faces.

A more complex object such as a human character could have thousands or even millions of [vertices](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Math/Objects/vertex.md), edges, and faces.

Meshes can be represented in a variety of different ways, including polygon meshes, point clouds, and [voxel](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Math/Objects/voxel.md) grids.

Polygon meshes are the most common type of mesh, and they are made up of triangles or quads.

Point clouds are made up of a set of points in three-dimensional space.

[Voxel](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Math/Objects/voxel.md) grids are made up of a three-dimensional array of [voxels](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Math/Objects/voxel.md), which are small cube-like cells.

The type of mesh that is used depends on the specific application.

For example, polygon meshes are well-suited for representing objects with smooth surfaces, while point clouds and [voxel](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Math/Objects/voxel.md) grids are more efficient for representing objects with complex or irregular shapes.

Meshes are a powerful tool that can be used to represent a wide variety of three-dimensional objects.

They are used in a variety of fields, and they play an important role in computer graphics, engineering, and medicine.
