Definition: 

Computationally expensive means that a task requires a significant amount of computing power to complete. This can be due to the complexity of the task, the amount of data involved, or the algorithm used.

Computationally expensive tasks can be difficult to run on traditional computers, and they may require specialized hardware or software. This can limit the availability of these tasks to users, and it can also make them more expensive to run.

**Computationally expensive tasks are an important part of many fields, such as science, engineering, and finance.** They allow us to solve complex problems and make predictions that would not be possible otherwise. However, these tasks can be challenging to run and may require specialized hardware or software.**

Here are some examples of computationally expensive tasks:

- **Training machine learning models**
- **Rendering high-resolution graphics**
- **Simulating complex systems**
- **Solving large systems of equations**
- **Analyzing large datasets**

Computationally expensive tasks are often the driving force behind technological advancement. They allow us to explore new frontiers and make discoveries that would not be possible otherwise.
