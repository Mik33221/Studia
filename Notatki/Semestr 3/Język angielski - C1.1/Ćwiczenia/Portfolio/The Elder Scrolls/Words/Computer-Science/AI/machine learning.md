Definition:

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.


[ML algorithms](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Computer-Science/AI/machine-learning%20algorithm.md) can be trained to perform a wide range of tasks, such as predicting the likelihood of a customer purchasing a product, identifying fraudulent transactions, or recognizing objects in images.
The core principle of ML is that by analyzing large amounts of data, [algorithms](/Notatki/Semestr%203/Język%20angielski%20-%20C1.1/Ćwiczenia/Portfolio/The%20Elder%20Scrolls/Words/Computer-Science/General/algorithm.md) can identify patterns and relationships that would be difficult or impossible for humans to detect. This allows ML systems to make predictions or decisions without relying on explicit instructions.

- **Data-driven:** ML algorithms learn from data, allowing them to adapt and improve their performance over time.
- **Predictive:** ML algorithms can make predictions about future events or outcomes based on their understanding of patterns in data.
- **Unsupervised:** ML algorithms can be trained on unlabeled data, allowing them to identify patterns and groupings in data without pre-defined categories.
- **Supervised:** ML algorithms can be trained on labeled data, allowing them to learn to associate inputs with corresponding outputs.

ML is a rapidly growing field with applications in a wide range of domains, including finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. It is expected to play an increasingly important role in our lives in the years to come.
