Translation: **Segmentacja**

Definition: 

The process of dividing a whole into parts or segments.

Segmentation can be used to divide data, images, or other objects into smaller, more manageable pieces.

It is a common technique in machine learning and data analysis, and it can be used for a variety of tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and data mining.

Segmentation can be done manually or automatically.

Manual segmentation is often used when the data is relatively simple and the segmentation boundaries are easy to identify.

Automatic segmentation is often used when the data is more complex or the segmentation boundaries are not as clear.

There are many different algorithms for image segmentation, and the best algorithm for a particular task will depend on the specific data and the desired outcome.

- **Thresholding:** This algorithm divides an image into two segments by comparing each pixel to a threshold value.
    
- **Clustering:** This algorithm groups pixels together based on their similarity.
    
- **Watershed segmentation:** This algorithm uses a watershed-like algorithm to find the boundaries between segments.
    
- **Active contour:** This algorithm uses an active contour model to segment an image.
    

Segmentation is a powerful tool that can be used to extract information from data, images, and other objects.

It is a versatile technique that can be used for a variety of tasks, and it is an essential part of many machine learning and data analysis pipelines.

- **Medical imaging:** Segmentation is used to identify tumors, organs, and other structures in medical images.
    
- **Satellite imagery:** Segmentation is used to identify roads, buildings, and other features in satellite imagery.
    
- **Video analysis:** Segmentation is used to track objects and events in video footage.
    
- **Social network analysis:** Segmentation is used to identify groups of people and communities in social networks.
    
- **Market research:** Segmentation is used to divide customers into groups based on their needs and preferences.
