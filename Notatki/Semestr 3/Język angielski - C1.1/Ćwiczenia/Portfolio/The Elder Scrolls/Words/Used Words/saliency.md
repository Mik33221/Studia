Definition:
**Salience** is the property of being easily noticed or attracting attention. It is a measure of the prominence of an object or concept in a particular context. Salience can be based on a number of factors, including sensory properties, such as brightness, contrast, and movement; social factors, such as novelty, familiarity, and emotional valence; and cognitive factors, such as relevance, importance, and surprise.

Salience is a key concept in a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and computer vision. It is used to explain how we perceive and process information, how we make decisions, and how we interact with the world around us.

Example:
The bright red stop sign is salient in the traffic scene, making it easy for drivers to notice.
