Definition:

In English, the word "coherent" has several meanings. Here are two of the most common:

2. **Logically consistent:** A coherent argument is one that is well-reasoned and makes sense from start to finish. It does not contradict itself or introduce any irrelevant information.
    
4. **Maintaining a single idea:** A coherent piece of writing or speech is one that sticks to a single main idea and does not digress or introduce irrelevant topics. It flows smoothly from one point to the next and maintains a consistent tone and style.
    

Example:
The professor's lecture was very coherent, and I was able to follow his train of thought easily.
