Definition:

A tangent plane is a plane that touches a surface at a single point. It is the best approximation to the surface near that point.

Tangent planes are used to study the behavior of surfaces near a specific point. They can also be used to approximate the surface over a small area.

Tangent planes are a fundamental concept in differential geometry and have applications in many fields, including physics, engineering, and computer graphics.

Examples:
- **Physics:** Tangent planes are used to model the behavior of objects near a specific point.
- **Engineering:** Tangent planes are used to design structures that are strong and stable.
- **Computer graphics:** Tangent planes are used to render 3D graphics with smooth surfaces.
