Translation: **Wypaczona sferoida**

Definition:

A degenerate spheroid is a spheroid that has one or more axes of symmetry that are infinitely long. In other words, it is a spheroid that is stretched out along one or more directions.

Degenerate spheroids are a special case of spheroids. They are not as common as regular spheroids, but they can still be useful for modeling certain objects.

- **Line segments:** Line segments are degenerate spheroids with two infinitely long axes.
    
- **Planes:** Planes are degenerate spheroids with one infinitely long axis.
    
- **Points:** Points are degenerate spheroids with all axes infinitely long.
    
Degenerate spheroids are a fundamental concept in geometry and have applications in many fields, including physics, engineering, and computer graphics.

Examples:
- **Physics:** Degenerate spheroids are used to model the behavior of objects that are infinitely long, such as wires and rods.
- **Engineering:** Degenerate spheroids are used to design structures that are strong and stable, such as beams and columns.
- **Computer graphics:** Degenerate spheroids are used to render 3D graphics with elongated objects.
