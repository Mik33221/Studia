A 3D Gaussian kernel is a mathematical function that represents the probability distribution of a random variable. It is a 3D function that decays exponentially as the distance from the origin increases.

|**Mathematical function** |A 3D Gaussian kernel is a mathematical function that represents the probability distribution of a random variable.|
|**Probability distribution** |A 3D Gaussian kernel represents the probability of a random variable taking on a particular value.|
|**Decays exponentially** |The value of a 3D Gaussian kernel decays exponentially as the distance from the origin increases.|
|**Used in image processing and computer vision** |3D Gaussian kernels are used in image processing and computer vision for a variety of tasks, such as blurring, edge detection, and filtering.|

3D Gaussian kernels are a fundamental tool in image processing and computer vision. They are used to smooth out noise, enhance edges, and extract features from images.

Example:
To blur an image, we can apply a 3D Gaussian kernel to each pixel in the image. The kernel will smooth out the edges in the image, making it appear less sharp.
