Definition:

A self-intersecting shape is a shape that crosses itself, meaning that its lines or curves pass through each other. Self-intersecting shapes are not considered to be valid in geometry, but they can still be useful for modeling certain objects.

|**Lines or curves pass through each other** |Self-intersecting shapes have lines or curves that pass through each other.|
|**Not valid in geometry** |Self-intersecting shapes are not considered to be valid in geometry.|
|**Can still be useful for modeling certain objects** |Self-intersecting shapes can still be useful for modeling certain objects.|

Self-intersecting shapes can be used to model certain objects, such as knots and pretzels. They can also be used to create interesting and unusual patterns.

Example:
A Klein bottle is a self-intersecting surface that has no inside or outside.
