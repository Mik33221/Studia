Translation: **Planarna izometria**

Definition:

A planar isometry is a transformation that preserves the distances between points in a plane. In other words, if you take a point in the plane and apply a planar isometry to it, the distance between that point and any other point in the plane will be the same as the distance between the original point and the transformed point.

Planar isometries are a type of affine transformation. Affine transformations are a broader class of transformations that also preserve the parallelism of lines and the ratios of lengths between segments.

- **Translations:** Translations are isometries that simply move all points in a plane by a fixed distance in a fixed direction.
    
- **Reflections:** Reflections are isometries that flip all points in a plane about a line called the axis of reflection.
    
- **Rotations:** Rotations are isometries that rotate all points in a plane about a point called the center of rotation.
    

Planar isometries are a fundamental concept in geometry and have applications in many fields, including computer graphics, engineering, and physics.
