# Introduction

In the intriguing realm where archaeology converges with advanced imaging techniques and computational innovation, this project embarks on the quest to unravel the secrets hidden within ancient scrolls. Inspired by the groundbreaking research led by Brent Seales and his team at the University of Kentucky, as well as the remarkable accomplishment of a young computer science enthusiast, Luke Farritor, our mission is to explore how seemingly unreadable texts from ancient scrolls can be digitally decoded. Seales and his team utilized X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans and sophisticated computational methods to virtually unwrap a delicate ancient scroll discovered in the En-Gedi synagogue, revealing sections of the Book of Leviticus. Simultaneously, Farritor's machine-learning algorithm successfully deciphered Greek letters on carbonized scrolls from Herculaneum, showcasing non-invasive approaches to studying fragile artifacts. Our primary goals involve amalgamating advanced imaging techniques with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, aiming to develop a versatile toolkit for deciphering unreadable ancient scrolls. Beyond technological advancements, we underscore the importance of learning and preserving discipline-specific languages, recognizing that linguistic expertise is crucial for unraveling the stories embedded within these ancient texts. Ultimately, our project seeks to utilize artificial intelligence to preserve and unlock the rich historical and cultural heritage encapsulated within these previously impenetrable documents.
