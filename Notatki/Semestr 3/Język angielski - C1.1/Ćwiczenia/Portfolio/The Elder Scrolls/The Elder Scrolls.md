# Introduction

The primary objectives of this project were to understand the methodologies for deciphering seemingly indecipherable texts without the destruction of source material, and to find out how to employ new technologies in preparation of data for further analysis. In particular, the project focuses on usage of X-ray machines to prepare and read ancient scrolls, preserving their integrity while uncovering valuable insights. By engaging in academic paper reading, I aim to enhance my understanding of the unique vocabulary associated with mathematics and computer science used in academic papers to further understand the methodologies.

# Language Proficiency Gains

Before starting the English for Specific Purposes (ESP) project, my language skills in the math field were quite basic. However, thanks to this project, there has been a noticeable improvement in my language proficiency. In terms of writing, I now have a better understanding of the structure and details of scientific articles. I have improved in using math-specific language and come across new terms that are mind-boggling. I've also encountered and understood some computer science terminology. In terms of reading, I've become much better at understanding and analyzing specialized texts in the field. Moreover, my speaking skills have progressed as I've tried to actively participate in discussions that require the effective use of discipline-specific language. Overall, this ESP project has been crucial in my personal development, helping me use discipline-specific language more effectively and communicate confidently in both writing and speaking.

# Future Goals

The knowledge gained from these articles not only provides insights into a fascinating application of AI but also leaves me with know-how about computational pipelines, data preparation and interdisciplinary collaboration. All of which are highly valuable in future endeavors as a computer science professional. Additionally, it shows that commitment to continuous learning could result in achieving things that ware thought impossible.
