# Future Goals

The knowledge gained from these articles not only provides insights into a fascinating application of AI but also leaves me with know-how about computational pipelines, data preparation and interdisciplinary collaboration. All of which are highly valuable in future endeavours as a computer science professional. Additionally, it shows that commitment to continuous learning could result in achieving things that ware thought impossible.
